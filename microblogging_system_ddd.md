# Building a Microblogging System üõ†Ô∏è

## Overview üåü

Welcome to the microblogging system project! This document serves as a guide to architecting, designing, building, testing, and deploying a microblogging web application using Domain-Driven Design (DDD). Before diving in, we highly recommend reading the "high-performance-guide.md" to understand the basic nuances of DDD and how it applies to our project. üìò

## Project Stages üöÄ

Each stage of building a microblogging system involves different steps:

1. **Architect:** Plan the overall structure and technologies.
2. **Design:** Create detailed designs and mockups.
3. **Build:** Implement the system using code.
4. **Test:** Verify that each part of the system works as expected.
5. **Deploy:** Make the system available to users.

## Microservices Example in Blogging System

- **User Service:** Manages user registration, login, and profile.
- **Post Service:** Handles creating, reading, updating, and deleting posts.
- **Comment Service:** Manages comments on posts.
- **Notification Service:** Sends notifications to users about new activities.

## Technologies Used üíª

We will use the following technologies:

- JavaScript: A programming language for web development.
- Node.js: A runtime for executing JavaScript on the server.
- Express.js: A web framework for Node.js.
- TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.

## Key Concepts of DDD üß©

In this project, we will model the domain using the following core concepts of DDD:

- Entities: e.g., `User`, `Post`
- Value Objects: e.g., `Content`
- Aggregates: e.g., `Post` with comments and likes
- Repositories: e.g., `PostRepository`
- Services: e.g., `NotificationService`

## User Service: Detailed Structure ü§ñ

### Entities üè∞

**User Entity:** Represents a user with unique attributes like `userID`, `username`, and `email`.

```typescript
class User {
    constructor(
        public userID: string,
        public username: string,
        public email: string,
        public password: string
    ) {}
}

```

### Value Objects üß±

**User Entity:** Represents the user's profile details.

```typescript
class Profile {
    constructor(
        public firstName: string,
        public lastName: string,
        public bio: string,
        public avatarUrl: string
    ) {}
}

```

### Aggregates üì¶

**User Aggregate:** Combines the User entity and the Profile value object.

```typescript
class UserAggregate {
    constructor(
        public user: User,
        public profile: Profile
    ) {}
}

```

### Repositories üè¶

**UserRepository:** Provides methods to add, remove, and retrieve users from the database.

```typescript
interface IUserRepository {
    create(user: UserAggregate): Promise<void>;
    findById(userID: string): Promise<UserAggregate>;
    findByEmail(email: string): Promise<UserAggregate>;
    update(user: UserAggregate): Promise<void>;
    delete(userID: string): Promise<void>;
}

```
**Implementation:** 

```typescript
class UserRepository implements IUserRepository {
    async create(user: UserAggregate): Promise<void> {
        // Logic to create a user in the database
    }

    async findById(userID: string): Promise<UserAggregate> {
        // Logic to find a user by ID
    }

    async findByEmail(email: string): Promise<UserAggregate> {
        // Logic to find a user by email
    }

    async update(user: UserAggregate): Promise<void> {
        // Logic to update a user in the database
    }

    async delete(userID: string): Promise<void> {
        // Logic to delete a user from the database
    }
}

```

### Services üõ°Ô∏è

**UserService:** Manages user-related operations such as registration, login, and profile updates.

```typescript
class UserService {
    private userRepository: IUserRepository;

    constructor(userRepository: IUserRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    async register(username: string, email: string, password: string): Promise<void> {
        const userID = generateUniqueId(); // Function to generate a unique ID
        const newUser = new User(userID, username, email, password);
        const profile = new Profile('', '', '', '');
        const userAggregate = new UserAggregate(newUser, profile);
        await this.userRepository.create(userAggregate);
    }

    async login(email: string, password: string): Promise<UserAggregate> {
        const user = await this.userRepository.findByEmail(email);
        if (user && user.user.password === password) {
            return user;
        } else {
            throw new Error('Invalid email or password');
        }
    }

    async updateProfile(userID: string, profile: Profile): Promise<void> {
        const userAggregate = await this.userRepository.findById(userID);
        userAggregate.profile = profile;
        await this.userRepository.update(userAggregate);
    }
}

```

## Next Steps üîç

Now that we have defined the User Service in detail, we will proceed to:

- Implement the Post Service, which handles creating, reading, updating, and deleting posts.
- Define and implement the Comment Service and Notification Service.
- Integrate these services to form a complete microblogging system.
